# **Proof of Concept: OpenAI Gym CartPole Simulation**

## **Introduction**
This document provides a **proof of concept (PoC)** for using **OpenAI Gym** to simulate a reinforcement learning environment. The code demonstrates how to create and interact with the `CartPole-v0` environment using Python.

---

## **Concepts Involved**

### **1. OpenAI Gym**
**OpenAI Gym** is a toolkit for developing and comparing **reinforcement learning** (RL) algorithms. It provides a collection of predefined environments for RL experimentation.

### **2. CartPole Environment**
The **CartPole** problem is a **classic control** problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart. The environment provides observations (states), takes actions, and gives rewards based on how well the pole remains balanced.

### **3. Reinforcement Learning Terms**
- **Observation (`obs`)**: The state representation of the environment.
- **Action (`action`)**: A decision taken by the agent.
- **Reward (`reward`)**: A score given by the environment to guide learning.
- **Episode**: A complete sequence of state transitions until termination.

## **Code Explanation**

### **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
```python
import gym  # OpenAI Gym library
import numpy as np  # Numerical operations
import time  # For controlling simulation speed
```
- `gym`: Used to create and interact with the CartPole environment.
- `numpy`: Helps with numerical operations (not used in this code but useful for RL tasks).
- `time`: Adds delay to control the rendering speed.

### **Step 2: Create the Environment**
```python
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
```
- `gym.make('CartPole-v0')` initializes the **CartPole environment**.
- This provides an **observation space** (state) and an **action space** (discrete actions like left or right movement).

### **Step 3: Define Number of Episodes**
```python
num_episodes = 5
```
- The simulation will run for **5 episodes**.
- Each episode runs until the pole falls over (done = `True`).

### **Step 4: Run the Simulation**
```python
for episode in range(num_episodes):
  obs = env.reset()
  done = False
  total_reward = 0
  print(f"Episode {episode + 1} starting...")
```
- **Loop through multiple episodes**.
- `env.reset()` **resets** the environment at the start of each episode.
- `done = False` ensures the episode runs until termination.
- `total_reward` tracks the cumulative reward.

### **Step 5: Simulate Actions in the Environment**
```python
  while not done:
    env.render()
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward
    time.sleep(0.05)
```
- **`env.render()`**: Displays the graphical simulation of the CartPole environment.
- **`env.action_space.sample()`**: Randomly selects an action (either move left or right).
- **`env.step(action)`**: Executes the action and returns:
  - `obs`: The new state.
  - `reward`: The reward for the action.
  - `done`: Whether the episode has ended.
  - `info`: Additional debug information (not used here).
- **`total_reward`** accumulates the rewards earned in that episode.
- **`time.sleep(0.05)`** slows down the simulation for better visualization.

### **Step 6: Print Episode Results**
```python
  print(f"Episode {episode + 1} ended with total reward {total_reward}")
```
- Displays the total reward achieved in each episode.

### **Step 7: Close the Environment**
```python
env.close()
```
- Ensures proper shutdown of the simulation environment.

---

## **Expected Output**
During execution, the console will display something like:
```
Episode 1 starting...
Episode 1 ended with total reward 23.0
Episode 2 starting...
Episode 2 ended with total reward 15.0
...
```
And the **CartPole environment will be displayed visually**.

## **Conclusion**
- This **proof of concept** shows how to use OpenAI Gym for reinforcement learning experiments.
- The agent **randomly selects actions**, leading to varying results.
- To improve performance, a **reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Network)** can be implemented.
- OpenAI Gym is a **powerful tool** for RL research, simulation, and testing.

## **Next Steps**
To extend this project:
1. **Implement a Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent**.
2. **Use Neural Networks** to learn optimal policies.
3. **Modify the reward function** to test different strategies.
